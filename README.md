# [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) Emulator written in Go

Created by following Tobias Langhoff's [guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/).

I used this project to learn about emulation and the Go programming language.<br><br><br><br>
This emulator is in a working state but not a finished state.
